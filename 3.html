        <h3>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h3>
        <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/ ⓘ), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology
            of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript 
            on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]<br><br>
            <p>Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. 
            These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system 
            for non-browser usage is Node.js.</p>
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time–compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript s
tandard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. 
It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, 
standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>

The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, 
or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.<br><br>

Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct a
nd differ greatly in design.<br><br>
